# Framework-Braille-Display
A braille display for the Framework 13 laptop's touchpad, hopefully

## Project Status

⚠️ This project is still a work in progress. It is not usable, yet. ⚠️

If you are interested in helping design, test, or advise on this project, please reach out!

I'm not sure how long this project will take. The goal is to have a proof of concept by 2025-06-01.

## What is this?

This is a project to create a refreshable braille display, which is installable in the location of the Framework 13 laptop's touchpad.

A braille display is a device that allows blind and visually impaired people to read text on a computer screen by converting it to braille.

Manufacturing techniques, cost, etc. TBD.

## Why?

I am not blind. I am, however, disappointed in the lack of laptop-compatible braille displays, and the lack of affordable braille displays in general. I believe that an addition to the open source Framework laptop is a great way to make computers more accessible to visually impaired people from all countries.
